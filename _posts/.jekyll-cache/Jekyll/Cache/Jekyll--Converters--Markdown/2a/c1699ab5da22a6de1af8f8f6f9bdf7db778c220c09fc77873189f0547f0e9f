I"Æb<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Fast product development and rapid innovation require running many controlled online experiments on large user groups. This is challenging on multiple fronts, including <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id%3D2488217">cultural, organisational, engineering, and trustworthiness</a>.</p>

<p>To address these challenges, we need a holistic view of all our systems and their interactions: Â </p>

<ul>
  <li>For a holistic view, donâ€™t just track systems closely related to your experiments. This mitigates the risk of a positive outcome on specific systemsÂ translating into a negative global outcome.</li>
  <li>When developing new products, we need to know how events interact.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, imagine we plan to implement a new feature to increase user engagement. We can design a simple A/B test that measures the user engagement with our product for two randomised groups of users. Letâ€™s assume we ran the experiment and the test shows the engagement significantly increased for the <a href="https://engineering.grab.com/building-grab-s-experimentation-platform">treatment group</a>. Is it safe to roll out this feature? Not necessarily, since our experiment only monitored one metric without considering others.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s assume an application where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click-through_rate">click through rate</a> is a target metric we want to keep optimal since its value impacts our bottom line. Suppose we add a new feature and want to make sure our metric improves. We experiment and find it does improve our target metric. However, our DevOps team tells us the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_(computing)">server load</a>Â metrics degraded. Therefore, our next question is â€œare the server load metrics different between <a href="https://engineering.grab.com/building-grab-s-experimentation-platform">treatment and control</a>?â€.</p>

<p>Obviously, it gets complicated when you have many experiments and metrics. Manually keeping track of all the metrics and interactions is neither practical nor scalable. Therefore, we need a systemÂ that lets us build metrics, measure and track interactions, and also allows us to develop features enabling global optimisation across our various product verticals.</p>

<p>To build such a system, we must capture, ingest, and process data, and then serve the insights as part of our experiment results. In 2017, we started building the various layers to support this goal. In this post, we describe our progress, and lessons learned in building a system that ingests and processes petabytes of data for analytics.</p>

<h2 id="data-lakes-and-data-pipelines">Data Lakes and Data Pipelines</h2>

<p>The data pipeline concept is closely related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake">data lakes</a>. Just like a lake that rivers and smaller streams flow into, a data lake is where various data streams and sources are collected, stored and utilised. Typically, a data pipeline destination is a data lake.</p>

<p><img src="img/experimentation-platform-data-pipeline/image1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>[<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/big-data/datalakes-and-analytics/what-is-a-data-lake/">image source</a>]</p>

<p>Just as people use lakesÂ for different purposes, Product AnalyticsÂ andÂ Data Scientists use data lakes for many purposes, ranging from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining">data mining</a>Â to monitoring and alerting.</p>

<p>In contrast, a data pipeline is one way data is sourced, cleansed, and transformed before being added to the data lake. Moving data from a source to a destination can include steps such as copying the data, and joining or augmenting it with other data sources. A data pipeline is the sum of all the actions taken from the data source to its destination. It ensures the actions happen automatically and in a reliable way.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s consider two types of data pipelines: batch andÂ stream.Â When you ingest data in batches, data is imported at regularly scheduled intervals. On the other hand, real-time ingestion or streaming is necessary when information is very time-sensitive.</p>

<p>This post focuses on the lessons we learned while building our batch data pipeline.</p>

<h2 id="why-we-built-our-own-data-pipeline">Why We Built Our Own Data Pipeline</h2>

<p>At the beginning of 2018, we designed the first part of our Mobile event Collector and Dispenser system (McD) that lets our mobile and backend applications send data to a data pipeline. We started with a small number of events (few thousand per second). But with Grabâ€™s rapid growth, scaling our data pipelineÂ was challenging. At the time of writing, the McD service ingests approximately400,000 events per second. <img src="img/experimentation-platform-data-pipeline/image5.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Designing, implementing, and scaling our pipeline in less than a year was not easy. Also, we are a small and lean team. This affected the technologies we could use and how we developed and deployed the various components.</p>

<p>Most importantly, we needed to keep things operationally simple and reliable. For instance,Â we decided to seek frameworks that support some form of SQL and a high-level language, since SQL is popular among Grabbers.</p>

<h1 id="design-requirements">Design Requirements</h1>

<p>To kick off the process, we first interviewed the projectâ€™s potential stakeholders, including both product owners and engineers. Â </p>

<p>The two questions we asked were:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Who will access the data?</li>
  <li>What were their expectations in terms of lag between data being captured atÂ source and the data being available through the serving layer?</li>
</ol>

<p>This second question is often missed when building data warehouses and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">ETL</a> jobs. But for us, its answers were the cornerstone for future decisions.</p>

<p>From the answers, we realised we needed to support access patterns from different users:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Data analysts performing analytical tasks such as querying the data for counts, averages within specific date ranges (one day, one week), and specific granularity (i.e. one hour). As we need to provide new data daily, this use case has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement">SLA</a> of one day.</li>
  <li>Data scientists doing Exploratory Data Analysis, building a dataset for training machine learning models, running optimisation algorithms, and inferring simulation parameters.</li>
  <li>Quality assurance and support engineers searching for specific events who require very fine granular level access.Â Their SLA is at most a few hours.</li>
  <li>Advanced monitoring and anomalies detection systems requiring a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series">time series</a>Â at different granularity depending on the type of monitoring.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system">Expert systems</a>Â require both coarse and granular data while searching and aggregating across a dynamic set of variables.</li>
</ol>

<p>For each use case, we asked whether batch or streaming made more sense. We concluded that a one hour lag was acceptable for most of the applications, at least for the initial rollout. For theÂ data analysts,Â an SLAÂ of a few hours was acceptable.</p>

<p>These initial conclusions gave us a lot of food for thought, particularly in regard to the dataâ€™s layout in the data lake and what storage format we planned to use.</p>

<p>Our next question was: how would the various applications and stakeholders access data? All Grab analysts and data scientists use SQL and our backend applications talk to databases with SQL. It was clear we should access data through an SQL interface.</p>

<p>Our final question was about democratising access to our data. We knew we had core applications and users we wanted to support.Â But we also knew the collected data could be strategic to other stakeholders and future use cases. Since we are a small team,Â we would not be able to support thousands of concurrent ad-hoc queries. For this reason, we surface this data using the <a href="https://engineering.grab.com/scaling-like-a-boss-with-presto">Grabâ€™s general data lake</a> which is able to serve approximatelyÂ 3 million queries per month.</p>

<h1 id="the-experimentation-platform-exp-data-pipeline">The Experimentation Platform (ExP) Data Pipeline</h1>

<p>Following our initial information gathering sessions, we decided on these objectives:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Develop a pipeline for batch data, making sure it is highly available.</li>
  <li>Allow analytical queries that aggregate on a wide range of attributes.</li>
  <li>Allow building time series by specific event types.</li>
  <li>Allow an SQL-supporting query engine.</li>
  <li>DemocratiseÂ the data access.</li>
</ol>

<p>Our batch data pipelineâ€™s high-level architecture is pretty simple. It follows the pattern of most data warehouse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">ETL jobs</a> except that we do not need to export data. In our data pipeline, we perform two operations, Load and Transform, and write the result data into our data lake.</p>

<p>At a high level, we can think of the data pipeline as performing three key operations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Load the data the ingestion layer has written on Amazon S3.</li>
  <li>Transform the data by ordering and partitioning according to patterns discussed below.</li>
  <li>Write data to Amazon S3 and metadata to a metastore.</li>
</ol>

<p>We use standard technologies: Apache Spark for compute, Apache Hive for metastore, and Apache Airflow as the workflow engine. We run Apache Spark on top of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/emr/">AWS Elastic MapReduce</a>Â (EMR) with external AWS RDS and EC2 instances for Hive and Airflow.</p>

<p><img src="img/experimentation-platform-data-pipeline/image2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Particular topics of interest here are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HowÂ we partition the data to enable the different access patterns discussed above.</li>
  <li>How we used <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/emr/">EMR</a>Â and Airflow to achieve resilience and high availability.</li>
</ul>

<p>Letâ€™s first look at what partitioning data means.</p>

<p>For simplicity, we can think of data in a simple tabular format, just like a spreadsheet. Each row is a record and each column is an attribute. The columns can have a different range of values.</p>

<p>We can organise data stored in the storage layer in hierarchical groups, called partitions, based on rows or columns. The serving layer can use this structure to filter data that needs to be served. For large-scale data, it is convenient to define partitions based on the attributes of one or more columns.</p>

<p>Within a partition, data can be sorted depending on other attributes. Most data processing frameworks, including Apache Spark, support various partitioning schemes and sorting data within a partition (see <a href="https://deepsense.ai/optimize-spark-with-distribute-by-and-cluster-by/">https://deepsense.ai/optimize-spark-with-distribute-by-and-cluster-by/</a>). In our pipeline, we use these Spark features to minimise the data processed by the serving layer.</p>

<p>In our data, the time and event types are the key attributes. Every single event has the time that it was ingested and its associated event type.</p>

<p>Our goal is to minimise the data the query engine needs to process and serve a specific query. Each queryâ€™s workload is the combination of the data that needs to be accessed and the complexity of the operationÂ performed on the data. For analytical queries,Â common operations are data aggregation and transformations.</p>

<p>Most of our analytical workloads span across a small number ofÂ event typesÂ (between 2 to 10) and a time range from one hour to a few months.Â Our expert system and time seriesÂ systems workloads focus on a single event type. In these workloads, the time range can vary fromÂ a few hours to one day. A data scientistâ€™s typical workloadsÂ require accessing multiple event types and specific time ranges. For these reasons,Â we partitioned data by event type and ingestion time.</p>

<p><img src="img/experimentation-platform-data-pipeline/image3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This hierarchical structureâ€™ key advantagesÂ are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When retrieving data for a specific event, we donâ€™t need to scan other events or any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_index">index</a>. The same applies for time ranges.</li>
  <li>We do not need to maintain separate indexes and can easily reprocess part of the data.</li>
  <li>Workloads across multiple events and/or time ranges can be easily distributed across multiple processing systems, which can process a specific sub-partitionÂ in parallel.</li>
  <li>It is easier to enforce an Access Control List (ACL) by using the storage layer ACL system to restrict access to specificÂ events and a time range.</li>
  <li>We can reprocess a specific partition or a set of partitions without having to reprocess the full data.</li>
</ul>

<p>For storing the actual data in each partition,Â we considered two common storage formats and chose<a href="https://orc.apache.org/">Â Apache ORC</a>. We compared <a href="https://parquet.apache.org/">Apache Parquet</a> against ORC for our workloads. We found an increase in performanceÂ (time saved in retrieving the data and storage utilised) between 12.5% and 80% across different use cases when using ORC with Snappy compression vs equivalent data store in Parquet with Snappy compression.</p>

<p>Another key aspect was addressing the problem of High Availability of an AWS EMR. As of November 2018, AWS EMR does not support hot-standby and <a href="http://apache-spark-user-list.1001560.n3.nabble.com/Multi-master-Spark-td4025.html%2520https://mapr.com/community/s/detail/a5b0L0000001zqkQAA">Spark multi-master deployment</a>. We considered deploying Spark on top of Kubernetes but theÂ initial deploymentâ€™s overhead as well as operating a Kubernetes cluster appeared more complex than our adopted solution. We do plan to revisit Spark on Kubernetes.</p>

<p>The alternative approach we used was AWS EMR, which leverages the distributed nature of the airflow workers. We run one or more totally independent clusters for each availability zone. On the clusterâ€™s master node, we run the Apache Airflow worker, which pulls any new job from a queue. The Spark jobs are defined as Airflow tasks bundled into a <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/concepts.html">DAG</a>.</p>

<p>If a task fails, we automatically retry up to four times to overcome any transitory issues such as S3 API or KMS issues, availability of EC2 instances, or any other temporary issue with underlying resources.</p>

<p>Tasks are scheduled across different clusters and therefore different availability zones. If an availability zone fails, generally there is no impact on other tasksâ€™ executions. If two zones fail, thenÂ generallyÂ the impact is just a delay in when the data is available for serving.</p>

<p>For deployments requiring an upgrade of the EMR version or of internal libraries, we roll out the new version to a random <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html">availability zone</a>. This lets us perform <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html">canary deployments</a> on our core processing infrastructure. It also lets us rollback very quickly as the remaining availability zones suffice to execute the pipelineâ€™s workload. To do this, we use terraform and our GitLab CI.</p>

<p><img src="img/experimentation-platform-data-pipeline/image7.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="packaging-and-deployment-of-jobs">Packaging and Deployment of Jobs</h2>

<p>We believe our codeâ€™s architecture is also of interest. We use <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a>Â and write our Spark jobs in Python. However, to avoid performance penalties,Â we avoid processing the data within the Python VM. We do most of the processing using Spark SQL and the <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.3/programming-guide.html">PySpark APIs</a>. This lets us have comparable performance with the same job written in Scala or Java while using a programming language most of us are familiarÂ with.</p>

<p>A key aspect we addressed from the beginning was the package of the Spark jobs.</p>

<p>The Spark documentation lacks information on how you should package your Python application. This resulted in misleading assumptions on how to write complex applications in Python. Often, PysparkÂ jobs are written using a single file where all the logic and data models are defined. Another common approach is to package the libraries and install them as part of the EMR bootstrap process where custom libraries can be installed on each node.</p>

<p>We took a slightly different approach. We package our application using this pattern:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lib.zip, aÂ zip file containing all the internal modules and the defined data models. TheseÂ files are shared across different jobs.</li>
  <li>Each Spark job has a Python file which defines the jobâ€™s core logic and submits the job.</li>
  <li>Any configuration file is placed in S3 or in HDFS and loaded at runtime by the job.</li>
</ul>

<p>We deploy all the files on S3 using our deployment pipeline (Gitlab CI). This pattern gave us greater re-usability of our code across different Spark jobs. We can also deploy new job versions without re-deploying the full set of EMR clusters.</p>

<h1 id="lessons-learnt">Lessons Learnt</h1>

<p>Throughout our data pipelineâ€™s development, we learned important lessons that improved our original design. We also better understand what we can improve in the future.</p>

<p>The first lesson relates to the size of the master node and task node in EMR.</p>

<p>Our initial clusters had this setup:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Master node was using eitherÂ an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">m4.xlarge or m5.xlarge</a>Â instance.</li>
  <li>One core node was using an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">m4.2xlarge or m5.2xlarge</a> instance.</li>
  <li>A dynamic number of task nodes were using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">m4.2xlarge or m5.2xlarge</a>Â instances.</li>
</ul>

<p>The number of task nodes scaled up depending on the <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.0/running-on-yarn.html">number of containers pending</a>. They could go from 5 initial task nodes to 200 at a pace of 25 nodes added every 5 minutes, done automatically using our <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-automatic-scaling.html">scaling policy</a>. As we reached 100 nodes running on a single cluster,Â we noticed more task nodes failing during processing due to network timeout issues. This impacted our pipelineâ€™s reliability since a Spark task failing more than 4 times aborted the full Spark job.</p>

<p>To understand why the failure was happening, we examined the resource manager logs. We closely monitored the cluster while running a sample job of similar scale.</p>

<p>To monitor the cluster, we used EMRâ€™s default tools (<a href="http://ganglia.sourceforge.net/">Ganglia</a>) (as shown below) and custom monitoring tools for CPU, memory, and network on top of <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog</a>.Â We noticed the overall cluster was heavily used and sometimes the master node even failed to load the metrics.</p>

<p><img src="img/experimentation-platform-data-pipeline/image6.png" alt="" />
EMR cluster CPU monitoring with Ganglia</p>

<p>Initially, we thought this would not have had any impact on the Spark job as the EMR master node in our settings is not the Spark driver node. Our reasoning was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We deployed our <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html">applications in cluster mode</a>Â and therefore the Spark jobâ€™s driver would have been one of the task nodes.</li>
  <li>If the master was busy running the other services,Â such as the Spark history server and the Resource manager,Â it should have had no impact.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our reasoning was incorrect because, despite correctly assuming the Spark driver was aÂ task node, we did not consider that Spark on EMR relies on <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.1.1/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/ResourceModel.html">YARN</a>Â for all its resource allocation.</p>

<p>By looking more carefully at the logs on the Spark task, we noticed the tasks nodes were failing to communicate their status to the master node and would then shut themselves down. This was happening at the same time as high CPU and high I/O on the master node.</p>

<p>We rethought our deployment configuration. We used bigger master instances (m5.2xlarge) as well as much bigger task instances in lower numbers (r4.2xlarge) - up to 100 of them.</p>

<p>After a few weeks of initial deployment, we noticed our EMR clustersâ€™ core nodes failed quite regularly. This prevented the Spark job from being submitted, and would often require aÂ full cluster redeployment to get the system healthy. The error in the job indicated an HDFS issue (<a href="#h.31ylir67bz7z">see error log below</a>). In our case, HDFS is only used to store the jobâ€™s metadata, such as the libraries, the configurations, and the main scripts. YARN also uses HDFS to store the logs.</p>

<p>We monitored the core nodes more closely and tried to replicate the issue by running an equal number of Spark jobsÂ to the total number of jobs processed by failed clusters. In our test, we monitored the core node directly, meaning we connected to the node and monitored it with tools such as iostat and iotop.</p>

<p>We noticed that after a while the Spark jobsâ€™ logs were using a considerable amount of the HDFS resources. We checked the defaults <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-spark-configure.html">configuration in EMR for â€˜spark-defaults.confsâ€™</a> and tweaked the original configuration with:</p>

<p>{</p>

<p>Â  Â  Â  â€œClassificationâ€: â€œspark-defaultsâ€,</p>

<p>Â  Â  Â  â€œPropertiesâ€:{ Â  Â  Â  Â â€spark.history.fs.cleaner.enabledâ€ : â€œtrueâ€ ,</p>

<p>Â  Â  Â  Â  â€œspark.history.fs.cleaner.maxAgeâ€: Â â€72hâ€,</p>

<p>Â  Â  Â  Â  â€œspark.history.fs.cleaner.intervalâ€ : â€œ1hâ€</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>}</p>

<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>

<p>We have processed over 2.5 PB of data in the past 3 and a half months while minimising the storage used on S3 (500 TB)Â as shown below. The storage saving is related to both ORC and our partition scheme. After this initial batch data pipeline, our focus has shifted to the streaming data pipeline and serving layer. We plan to improve this setup, especially as new Spark releases improve Kubernetes and Apache Spark support.</p>
