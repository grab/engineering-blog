## Introduction 

Ten years ago, we launched our bug bounty program in partnership with [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com/blog). Beyond a security initiative, it represented an open invitation to collaborative development.
As pioneers in Southeast Asia, we began the program with 23 initial researchers, and it has since evolved into a global community of security researchers.

The strategic structure and scope of our Bug Bounty Program, combined with our continuous innovation and experimentation, have successfully captured the attention of the global security research community. Over the past decade, we have partnered with more than 850 active security researchers from HackerOne's community of over 2 million cybersecurity professionals worldwide. These dedicated researchers work alongside us across borders and time zones, forming a collaborative defense network that helps protect over 187 million users throughout Southeast Asia. Their ongoing participation demonstrates both the maturity of our program and the trust we've built within the security research community.

This milestone reflects the strength of shared purpose and our sustained partnership with the HackerOne platform. It demonstrates the value of human connection and the collective understanding that security is stronger through collaboration. Here's to a decade of partnership and to many more years of building a safer future, one collaboration at a time!

### Evolution and growth: Adapting to a dynamic threat landscape

Over the past ten years, our program has consistently adapted to the dynamic threat landscape and integrated invaluable feedback from our research community. We have grown from a private initiative to a program that consistently ranks among the top 20 worldwide and among the top 3 in Asia on HackerOne. Key milestones from our journey include:

* **Expanding our horizons:** Our scope significantly broadened in 2023-2024, continuously adding new assets and prominently including financial services in Indonesia and AI systems. This expansion provides researchers with more avenues to contribute to Grab's security.  
* **Focused mobile security:** We introduced a dedicated bounty table for mobile-specific issues, recognizing the unique challenges of mobile security.  
* **Incentivizing excellence:** We regularly experiment with campaigns of various types and targets, diversifying our reward methods to include both financial rewards and recognition.  
* **Evolving vulnerability focus:** We've observed a significant shift in the types of vulnerabilities reported over the decade, moving from foundational issues in early years to more sophisticated and emerging categories recently.

### The global stage: Connecting with the best

Our program's success is deeply rooted in its vibrant global community, which we actively foster through continuous engagement. Our strategy extends beyond the platform to major live hacking events, including the **ThreatCon Live Hacking Event 2023** **in Nepal** and **DEFCON 32's Live Recon Village 2024 in Las Vegas.** These initiatives have been instrumental in connecting us with a diverse pool of new talent and strengthening relationships with researchers across different continents. By meeting hackers where they are, we've not only brought new expertise into our ecosystem but also demonstrated our commitment to being an accessible and collaborative partner on a global scale.

The high participation and quality submissions from these events demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. They've expanded our global security testing coverage and strengthened our standing within the worldwide cybersecurity community. Through ongoing interactions and submitted reports, we continue to see that security is a collaborative effort with no borders.

### Exclusive anniversary celebrations: Global club campaigns

To commemorate our 10th anniversary, we launched three exclusive, invite-only campaigns with HackerOne's regional clubs in **Germany, Morocco, and India**. These campaigns served as cultural exchanges, bringing fresh perspectives from outside our core Southeast Asian consumer markets. By engaging with these clubs, we expanded our researcher community and connected with security experts who understand different threat landscapes and methodologies, bringing outside perspectives to our systems.

In August, we also ran a broader anniversary campaign that drew significant participation from the researcher community, resulting in 461 submissions. [xchopath](https://hackerone.com/xchopath?type=user) was awarded the Best Hacker Bonus for their contributions during this campaign.

These campaigns expanded our global security testing coverage and strengthened relationships with international researcher communities. Beyond vulnerability reports, they functioned as knowledge-sharing initiatives. We connected directly with researchers to learn from their experience and feedback, creating a continuous loop of improvement. This international collaboration also informed our global expansion security strategy by providing insights into how different regions approach digital payments and authentication.

The anniversary campaigns allowed us to validate our security frameworks against diverse regulatory environments and advanced testing methodologies from established security markets, reinforcing our commitment to maintaining robust security standards.

### Voices from our community 

Behind every vulnerability report is a researcher who chose to help make Grab safer. Their perspectives reveal the human side of our security evolution. These individuals are not just cybersecurity experts; they are partners in our mission to protect millions of users and ensure a safe digital environment. Here are a few testimonies from participants in our past campaigns:

* “The triage was very fast despite the time difference, which I really appreciated. The triaging experience was better than other programs. The huge scope and business portal with different user roles made it especially interesting to explore.” – [*ArtSec*](https://hackerone.com/artsec?type=user) *[H1 Germany club campaign participant]*

* “I liked that different countries have different features—this gives me more attack surface to explore. Response time was great, triage was very fast, and I appreciated Grab's effort in providing fast responses. The scope was huge with a lot of wildcards for reconnaissance.” – [*Sicksec*](https://hackerone.com/sicksec?type=user) *[H1 Morocco club campaign participant]*

* “More than 20 bugs were reported, and was particularly happy that bounties were being paid upon triage. The Germany team spent a lot of time on the educational part, especially for newcomers. Communication overall was very good, and the immediate response even outside working hours was really cool. SSO and authentication is my expertise and I liked that aspect of exploring the platform.” – [*Lauritz*](https://hackerone.com/lauritz?type=user) *[H1 Germany club campaign participant]*

### The road ahead: Our commitment to a secure future

With a strong community of security researchers across countries and a decade of collaboration, we've built meaningful partnerships. Every vulnerability report represents trust, and every discovery reflects dedication to our shared mission. The program demonstrates our choice to build together rather than work in isolation, to protect rather than exploit, and to collaborate rather than compete.

While we celebrate our external community, the success of our program relies equally on our dedicated internal teams. Our cybersecurity teams form the operational foundation of this initiative. Their consistent responsiveness and researcher-focused approach have enabled vulnerability reporting to evolve into a genuine partnership, maintaining researcher trust and keeping Grab secure.

The next ten years will bring challenges we can't yet imagine, from emerging threats in artificial intelligence to novel cryptographic approaches in a quantum-powered world. We will face them together as a community that spans cultures, time zones, and expertise.

Together, we'll continue securing Southeast Asia's digital future, one partnership, one discovery, one shared achievement at a time.
