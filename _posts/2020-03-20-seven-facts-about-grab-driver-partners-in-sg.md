## Grab’s Big Data Story

Grab is on an incredible mission to empower our driver-partners in 336 cities in 8 countries.

Curious about what Grab’s data tells us about driver-partners on the platform?

Let us share with you the most interesting data points we found among our driver-partners in Singapore!

### 1. It’s a Small World

</figure></div>

Lim Chu Kang may feel like a world away from Katong, but Singapore is a small world for our driver-partners — a driver-partner has a 1 in 400 chance of having a repeat passenger amongst the 5.4 million population!

### 2. Saturday Night Fever

</figure></div>

The annual average number of rides that a Grab driver-partner complete on Saturday nights is 110. But there was one special driver-partner who did 1,131 Saturday night trips in the year of 2018! Weekend parties just wouldn’t be the same without you. Rock on!

### 3. Share the Love

Did you know that having more passengers in a car can yield more 5-star ratings? Our GrabShare passengers share more than just rides — they share their appreciation too! GrabShare rides have an average trip rating of 4.8!

### 4. The Road More Travelled

Which neighbourhoods are painting the town green? Our driver-partners picked up the most passengers from Tampines, while Orchard & Marina Bay areas were the most popular destination in 2018!

### 5. Tricks of the Trade

Ever wondered if seasoned driver-partners who have been with us for more than 2 years, have different driving preferences and habits? They tend to start their day 1 hour earlier around 6–7am, and are on auto-accept most of the time. Did you know that drivers on auto-accept spend less time idle waiting for new bookings?

### 6. Busy Bee

Did you know? Drivers are twice as likely to get back-to-back allocations during evening peak hours! Drivers with frequent back-to-back bookings earn about 50% more per hour.

## 7. Road Runner

One of our most active driver-partners covered 57,000km ferrying passengers in 2018 — that’s like driving every road, street, jalan, lorong and tanjong in Singapore for more than 57 times!

How our driver-partners utilise the Grab platform to make a living (and break a few records along the way) never ceases to amaze us.
