  <li>Simplifying the GitLab CI file from 1800 lines to 50 lines.</li>
  <li>Reducing the need for nested <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gitlab-ci</code> yml files.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Cauldron is the Machine Learning (ML) Platform team at Grab. The Cauldron team provides tools for ML practitioners to manage the end to end lifecycle of ML models, from training to deployment. GitLab and its tooling are an integral part of our stack, for continuous delivery of machine learning.</p>

<p>One of our core products is MerLin Pipelines. Each team has a dedicated repo to maintain the code for their ML pipelines. Each pipeline has its own subfolder. We rely heavily on GitLab rules to detect specific changes to trigger deployments for the different stages of different pipelines (for example, model serving with Catwalk, and so on).</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<h3 id="approach-1-nested-child-files">Approach 1: Nested child files</h3>

<p>Our initial approach was to rely heavily on static code generation to generate the child <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gitlab-ci.yml</code> files in individual stages. See Figure 1 for an example directory structure. These nested yml files are pre-generated by our cli and committed to the repository.</p>

<div class="post-image-section">
  <img alt="Figure 1: Example directory structure with nested gitlab-ci.yml files. " src="img/how-we-reduced-our-ci-yaml/image6.png" />
  <small class="post-image-caption">Figure 1: Example directory structure with nested gitlab-ci.yml files. 
</small>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Child <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gitlab-ci.yml</code> files are added by using the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/%23include&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1650350504636970&amp;usg=AOvVaw3fcp3MHroupClqjgK0G9lm">include</a> keyword.</p>

<div class="post-image-section">
  <img alt="Figure 2: Example root .gitlab-ci.yml file, and include clauses." src="img/how-we-reduced-our-ci-yaml/image4.png" width="50%" />
  <small class="post-image-caption">Figure 2: Example root .gitlab-ci.yml file, and include clauses.</small>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="post-image-section">
  <img alt="Figure 3: Example child .gitlab-ci.yml file for a given stage (Deploy Model) in a pipeline (pipeline 1).

  <small class="post-image-caption">Figure 3: Example child `.gitlab-ci.yml` file for a given stage (Deploy Model) in a pipeline (pipeline 1).
</small>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As teams add more pipelines and stages, we soon hit a limitation in this approach:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There was a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/%23include&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1650350504638326&amp;usg=AOvVaw2oke3Jgz-nrL_AeTdGfxsy">soft limit</a> in the number of includes that could be in the base <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It became evident that this approach would not scale to our use-cases.</p>

<h3 id="approach-2-dynamically-generating-a-big-ci-file">Approach 2: Dynamically generating a big CI file</h3>

<p>Our next attempt to solve this problem was to try to inject and inline the nested child <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gitlab-ci.yml</code> contents into the root <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gitlab-ci.yml</code> file, so that we no longer needed to rely on the in-built GitLab “include” clause.</p>

<p>To achieve it, we wrote a utility that parsed a raw <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gitlab-ci</code> file, walked the tree to retrieve all “included” child <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gitlab-ci</code> files, and to replace the includes to generate a final big <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gitlab-ci.yml</code> file.</p>

<p>Figure 4 illustrates the resulting file is generated from Figure 3.</p>

<div class="post-image-section">
  <img alt="Figure 4: “Fat” YAML file generated through this approach, assumes the original raw file of Figure 3.

  <small class="post-image-caption">Figure 4: “Fat” YAML file generated through this approach, assumes the original raw file of Figure 3.
</small>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This approach solved our issues temporarily. Unfortunately, we ended up with GitLab files that were up to 1800 lines long. There is also a soft limit to the size of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gitlab-ci.yml</code> files. It became evident that we would eventually hit the limits of this approach.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>Our initial attempt at using static code generation put us partially there. We were able to pre-generate and infer the stage and pipeline names from the information available to us. Code generation was definitely needed, but upfront generation of code had some key limitations, as shown above. We needed a way to improve on this, to somehow generate GitLab stages on the fly. After some research, we stumbled upon <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/parent_child_pipelines.html%23dynamic-child-pipelines&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1650350504640355&amp;usg=AOvVaw1QlQa6ojKe53DbYD8zuMEI">Dynamic Child Pipelines</a>.</p>

<p>Quoting the official website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead of running a child pipeline from a static YAML file, you can define a job that runs your own script to generate a YAML file, which is then used to trigger a child pipeline.</p>

  <p>This technique can be very powerful in generating pipelines targeting content that changed or to build a matrix of targets and architectures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We were already on the right track. We just needed to combine code generation with child pipelines, to dynamically generate the necessary stages on the fly.</p>

<h2 id="architecture-details">Architecture details</h2>

<div class="post-image-section">
  <img alt="Figure 5: Flow diagram of how we use dynamic yaml generation. The user raises a merge request in a branch, and subsequently merges the branch to master.
" src="img/how-we-reduced-our-ci-yaml/image8.png" width="75%" />

</small>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>The user Git flow can be seen in Figure 5, where the user modifies or adds some files in their respective Git team repo. As a refresher, a typical repo structure consists of pipelines and stages (see Figure 1). We would need to extract the information necessary from the branch environment in Figure 5, and have a stage to programmatically generate the proper stages (for example, Figure 3).</p>

<p>In short, our requirements can be summarized as:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Detecting the files being changed in the Git branch.</li>
  <li>Extracting the information needed from the files that have changed.</li>
  <li>Passing this to be templated into the necessary stages.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s take a very simple example, where a user is modifying a file in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stage_1</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pipeline_1</code> in Figure 1. Our desired output would be:</p>

<div class="post-image-section">
  <img alt="Figure 6: Desired output that should be dynamically generated." src="img/how-we-reduced-our-ci-yaml/image7.png" width="50%" />
  <small class="post-image-caption">Figure 6: Desired output that should be dynamically generated.
</small>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our template would be in the form of:</p>

<div class="post-image-section">
  <img alt="Figure 7: Example template, and information needed. Let’s call it template\_file.yml.
" src="img/how-we-reduced-our-ci-yaml/image5.png" width="50%" />
  <small class="post-image-caption">Figure 7: Example template, and information needed. Let’s call it template_file.yml.
</small>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, we need to detect the files being modified in the branch. We achieve this with native <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git diff</code> commands, checking against the base of the branch to track what files are being modified in the merge request. The output (let’s call it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diff.txt</code>) would be in the form of:</p>
<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="go">M        pipelines/pipeline_1/stage_1/modelserving.yaml
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<div class="post-image-section">
 <small class="post-image-caption">Figure 8: Example diff.txt generated from git diff.
 </small>
</div>

<p>We must extract the yellow and green information from the line, corresponding to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pipeline_name</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stage_name</code>.</p>

<div class="post-image-section">
  <img alt="Figure 9: Information that needs to be extracted from the file." src="img/how-we-reduced-our-ci-yaml/image9.png" />
  <small class="post-image-caption">Figure 9: Information that needs to be extracted from the file.
</small>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We take a very simple approach here, by introducing a concept called stop patterns.</p>

<p>Stop patterns are defined as a comma separated list of variable names, and the words to stop at. The colon (:) denotes how many levels before the stop word to stop.</p>

<p>For example, the stop pattern:</p>
<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s">pipeline_name:pipelines</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>tells the parser to look for the folder <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pipelines</code> and stop before that, extracting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pipeline_1</code> from the example above tagged to the variable name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pipeline_name</code>.</p>

<p>The stop pattern with two colons (::):</p>
<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s">stage_name::pipelines</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>tells the parser to stop two levels before the folder <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pipelines</code>, and extract <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stage_1</code> as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stage_name</code>.</p>

<p>Our cli tool allows the stop patterns to be comma separated, so the final command would be:</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="go">cauldron_repo_util diff.txt template_file.yml
</span><span class="gp">pipeline_name:pipelines,stage_name::pipelines &gt;</span><span class="w"> </span>generated.yml
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We elected to write the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">util</code> in Rust due to its high performance, and its rich templating libraries (for example, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/Keats/tera&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1650350504647300&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Kcz6NyWYSn8qTFAq3LKVY">Tera</a>) and decent cli libraries (<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/clap-rs/clap&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1650350504647640&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Hdwy09Rx-G4Mi5TX6C2Rp">clap</a>).</p>

<p>Combining all these together, we are able to extract the information needed from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git diff</code>, and use stop patterns to extract the necessary information to be passed into the template. Stop patterns are flexible enough to support different types of folder structures.</p>

<div class="post-image-section">
  <img alt="Figure 10: Example Rust code snippet for parsing the Git diff file.

  <small class="post-image-caption">Figure 10: Example Rust code snippet for parsing the Git diff file.
</small>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When triggering pipelines in the master branch (see right side of Figure 5), the flow is the same, with a small caveat that we must retrieve the same <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diff.txt</code> file from the source branch. We achieve this by using the rich GitLab API, retrieving the pipeline artifacts and using the same util above to generate the necessary GitLab steps dynamically.</p>

<h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>

<p>After implementing this change, our biggest success was reducing one of the biggest ML pipeline Git repositories from 1800 lines to 50 lines. This approach keeps the size of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitlab-ci.yaml</code> file constant at 50 lines, and ensures that it scales with however many pipelines are added.</p>

<p>Our users, the machine learning practitioners, also find it more productive as they no longer need to worry about GitLab yaml files.</p>

<h2 id="learnings-and-conclusion">Learnings and conclusion</h2>

<p>With some creativity, and the flexibility of GitLab Child Pipelines, we were able to invest some engineering effort into making the configuration re-usable, adhering to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%2527t_repeat_yourself&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1650350504649348&amp;usg=AOvVaw1BvnjkSdVOEBvnpPqP4nuD">DRY</a> principles.</p>
