<p>When was the last time you met someone who was happy with his or her job?</p>

<p>Yeah, me too. Complaining about work is probably one of the greatest Singaporean pastimes yet.</p>

<p>A recent study conducted by <a href="http://www.jobstreet.com.sg/career-resources/singapores-workforce-ranks-unhappiest-amongst-asian-counterparts-2/#.WKFd8xJ97sk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JobStreet</a> found that Singaporean workers were the most dissatisfied in the region. Out of the 7 Asian countries surveyed, Singaporean workers had the lowest average job satisfaction rating at 5.09 out of 10.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s close to failing, something we donâ€™t take kindly to. Hereâ€™s how we measure up:</p>

</div>

<p>Simply put, itâ€™s not easy to find a job that youâ€™ll be happy in. Each stage of the hiring process - from attending interviews to negotiating job offers - reveals a bit more information about your future position, but much of it is cloaked in hearsay and secrecy.</p>

<p>We, however, are on your side. We want to make the hiring process as transparent as possible so that you, dear reader, will be able to make a more informed choice. After all, this is the job that youâ€™ll spend a good bulk of your time at.</p>

<p>For this reason, weâ€™re embarking on a series of articles that will uncover the hiring processes of leading technology companies in Singapore. Let us know how we can improve on this - what other information youâ€™d like to see, which companies youâ€™d like to read about here, and so on.</p>

<p>First up, a mobility services company that has <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/companies/grab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised US$1.4 billion in funding</a> (that we know of) to date - <strong>Grab</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="interview-process-at-grab">Interview Process at Grab</h3>

<p>Not surprisingly, they experience a high volume of inbound candidates for some of their more popular roles, but few make it to the final stage. â€œOn average, it could be as low as 3 to 5 per cent of candidates who start the interview process to reach to offer stage, as our bar for engineering talent is set really high â€“ for good reason!â€ Rachel explains.</p>

<p>From start to end, the number of interview rounds highly depends on the role in question, and how senior the position is. A 100offer user who recently joined Grab tells us that his journey took between three to four weeks, during which he went through the following interview rounds: one phone screen interview with a Human Resources representative, one online coding round, and two rounds of technical tests.</p>

<p>The final technical round was conducted with three Grab software engineers in quick succession.</p>

<p>In the first cut, Rachel takes a look at a variety of factors to assess if an engineering candidate is suitable or not.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œ[First], we take a look at their demonstrated ability in previous projects as listed on GitHub. The complexity of the projects is of interest to us,â€ she says. â€œI will seek out their blogs, slideshow presentations, as well as review peer recommendations to ensure I am able to create a more holistic profile of the individual.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the subject of qualifications, she deems them to be secondary, as â€œmany qualified and suitable candidates for us would not have passed a typical CV screen otherwise.â€</p>

<h3 id="technical-vs-cultural-fit">Technical vs. Cultural Fit</h3>

<div class="post-image-section">
  <img alt="Happy Grab Employees" src="/img/how-grab-hires-engineers-in-singapore/happy-grab-employees.jpg" />
</div>

<p>Beyond technical proficiency and competency, however, they also take special care to evaluate if candidates fit Grabâ€™s culture and values:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œTo succeed and thrive in a growing company, we want adaptable people, equally balanced with soft and hard skills, who are driven and eager to make a difference to solving and improving transportation in Southeast Asia.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like a tall order? Bear in mind that only 3 to 5% of candidates actually get an offer.</p>

<p>To be part of this select group, Rachel explains that there are some hard and soft skills that she tends to look out for:</p>

<h4 id="hard-skills">Hard Skills</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Experience developing software that is highly scalable, distributed service geared for low latency read requests</li>
  <li>Experience building complex distributed systems - helping our systems to be faster, more scalable, more reliable, better!</li>
  <li>Mobile experience - Different than other engineering roles but share a lot of the same attributes, show some interest and knowledge in these areas: applications, data, and mobile UI/UX</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="soft-skills">Soft Skills</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Willingness to collaborate</li>
  <li>Thoughtful communication style with clearly thought through, logical solutions</li>
  <li>Entrepreneurial spirit and a track record of doing whatever it takes to succeed</li>
</ul>

<p>Between cultural and technical fit, which weighs more heavily in Grabâ€™s hiring process? To Rachel, both are equally important, though cultural fit is critical in sealing the deal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œNo matter how technically capable a candidate is, we will not proceed with a job offer if the team will not enjoy working with the person,â€ she says. â€œWe are really focused on creating and maintaining a great working culture at Grab!â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rachel uses the example of one of Grabâ€™s principles, â€œYour problem is my problem.â€</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œWe want people who will take the initiative to offer help to their fellow colleagues.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="grabs-interview-questions">Grabâ€™s Interview Questions</h4>

<p>For Rachel, sheâ€™s â€œlaser focused on strategic recruitment for mid- to senior- level hires in engineering, and she â€œexpects all our future Grabbers to come with a high level of technical ability.â€ The questions she asks candidates in the technical rounds follow accordingly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œFor senior leaders, we ask them about the last, or the best technical decisions they have made recently, that had impact on scalability and high availability performant systems; as well as their thought processes around design for solutions for backend microservices, if not, in areas of their pursuant domain.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition, our 100offer user recalls that he was fielded more algorithm questions than other interviews that he attended previously.</p>

<p>Beyond that, Rachel and her colleagues tend to quiz candidates on their career ambitions, as well as find out whether they have â€œa good aptitude for learning and collaboration with colleagues from all around the world.â€ This is necessary as Grab currently has more than 30 nationalities in their ranks.</p>

<p>For senior candidates, Rachel will â€œoften ask them their views on their hiring philosophy - how they would hire a good engineer, as well as how they would build a strong, cohesive and high-performing team.â€</p>

<p>â€œIt is critical that we understand a senior candidateâ€™s management style,â€ she emphasises.</p>

<p>For junior candidates, she would ask questions that help give a sense of their sense of responsibility and interest in being a team owner and manager, as well as their commitment to building a long and successful career with Grab.</p>

<p>â€œQuestions we ask are focused on assessing future aptitude for leadership roles, and their analytical skills and thought processes when it comes to solving problems.â€</p>

<h4 id="insider-tips">Insider Tips</h4>

<p>According to Rachel, there are many opportunities to relocate and work at Grabâ€™s Research &amp; Development Centres in Beijing, Seattle, and Singapore. When relocating candidates, though, she is careful to assess their ability to adapt to a new environment.</p>

<p>â€œI recognise that their entire life can change!â€ she explains. â€œFor those keen to explore an overseas work opportunity with Grab, do take time to consider and research about living in Singapore. Singapore is a great place for tech talent, as it comes with plenty of opportunities in the tech industry.â€</p>

<p>Indeed, sheâ€™s extremely optimistic about the prospects of those keen on moving to Singapore, where Grab chose to <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/singapore/grabtaxi-opens-s-136m-r-d/1772932.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open its US$100 million R&amp;D centre</a> - right in the heart of the Central Business District.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œThe city-state hosts a mature tech ecosystem and the abundance of local, regional and global companies is beneficial to tech professionals. Whatâ€™s more it has been consistently ranked as the top city in the world for technology readiness, transportation, infrastructure, tax and the ease of doing business by PwCâ€™s Cities of Opportunity report.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, she believes that working at Grab will be the â€œmost challenging yet rewarding opportunityâ€ any employee will ever encounter. This is due to the scale and speed at which they operate.</p>

<p>â€œI personally wouldnâ€™t trade this experience for anything else right now, and it makes it all the most critical to to have teammates who believe in the same - that we are all fighting a battle to bring lasting benefits and improvements to millions in Southeast Asia!â€</p>
