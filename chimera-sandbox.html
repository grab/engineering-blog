<p>Chimera Sandbox is a Notebook service platform. It allows users to launch multiple notebook and visualisation services for experimentation and development. The platform offers an extremely quick onboarding process enabling any Grabber to start learning, exploring and experimenting in just a few minutes. This inclusivity and ease of use have been key in driving the adoption of the platform across different teams within Grab and empowering all Grabbers to be GenAI-ready.</p>

<p>One significant challenge in harnessing ML for innovation, whether for technical experts or non-technical enthusiasts, has been the accessibility of resources. This includes GPU instances and specialised services for developing LLM-powered applications. Chimera Sandbox addresses this head-on by offering an extensive array of compute instances, both with and without GPU support, thus removing barriers to experimentation. Its deep integration with Grab’s suite of internal ML tools transforms the way users approach ML projects. Users benefit from features like hyperparameter tuning, tracking ML training metadata, accessing diverse LLMs through Grab’s AI Gateway, and experimenting with rich datasets from Grab’s data lake. Chimera Sandbox ensures that users have everything they need at their fingertips. This ecosystem not only accelerates the development process but also encourages innovative approaches to solving complex problems.</p>

<p>The underlying compute infrastructure of the Chimera Sandbox platform is Grab’s very own battle-tested, highly scalable ML compute infrastructure running on multiple Kubernetes clusters. Each cluster can scale up to thousands of nodes at peak times gracefully. This scalability ensures that the platform can handle the high computational demands of ML tasks. The robustness of Kubernetes ensures that the platform remains stable, reliable, and highly available even under heavy load. At any point in time, there can be hundreds of data scientists, ML engineers and developers experimenting and developing on the Chimera Sandbox platform.</p>

  </figure>
</div>

<h2 id="best-of-both-worlds">Best of both worlds</h2>

<p>Chimera Sandbox is suitable for both new users who want to explore and experiment ML solutions and advanced users who want to have full control over the Notebook services they run. Users can launch Notebook services using default Docker images provided by the Chimera Sandbox platform. These images come pre-loaded with popular data science and ML libraries and various Grab internal systems integrations. Chimera also provides basic Docker images from which the users can use as base images to build their own customised Notebook service Docker images. Once the images are built, the users can configure their Notebook services to use their custom Docker images. This ensures their Notebook environment can be exactly the way they want them to be.</p>

<div class="post-image-section"><figure>
  <img src="/img/chimera-sandbox/customise-notebook-packages.png" alt="" style="width:80%" /><figcaption align="middle">Figure 3. Users are able to customise their Notebook service with additional packages.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<h2 id="real-time-collaboration">Real-time collaboration</h2>
<p>The Chimera Sandbox platform also features a real-time collaboration feature. This feature fosters a collaborative environment where users can exchange ideas and work together on projects.</p>

<h2 id="cpu-and-gpu-choices">CPU and GPU choices</h2>

<p>Chimera Sandbox offers a wide variety of CPU and GPU choices to cater to specific needs, whether it is a CPU, memory, or GPU intensive experimentation. This flexibility allows users to choose the most suitable computational resources for their tasks, ensuring optimal performance and efficiency.</p>

<h2 id="deep-integration-with-spark">Deep integration with Spark</h2>

<p>The platform is deeply integrated with internal Spark engines, enabling users to experiment building  extract, transform, and load (ETL) jobs with data from Grab’s data lake. Integrated helpers such as SparkConnect Kernel and %%spark_sql magic cell, provide a faster developer experience, which can execute Spark SQL queries without needing to write additional code to start a Spark session and query.</p>

<div class="post-image-section"><figure>
  <img src="/img/chimera-sandbox/magic-cell.gif" alt="" style="width:80%" /><figcaption align="middle">Figure 4. %%spark_sql magic cell enables users to quickly explore data with Spark.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>In addition to Magic Cell, the Chimera Sandbox offers advanced Spark functionalities. Users can write PySpark code using pre-configured and configurable Spark clients in the runtime environment. The underlying computation engine leverages Grab’s custom Spark-on-Kubernetes operator, enabling support for large-scale Spark workloads. This high-code capability complements the low-code Magic Cell feature, providing users with a versatile data processing environment.</p>

<h2 id="ai-gallery">AI Gallery</h2>

<p>Chimera Sandbox features an AI Gallery to guide and accelerate users to start experimenting with ML solutions or building GenAI-powered applications. This is especially useful for new or novice users who are keen to explore what they can do on the Chimera Sandbox platform. With Chimera Sandbox, users are not just presented with a bare bones compute solution but rather are provided with ways to do ML tasks right from Chimera Sandbox Notebooks. This approach saves users from the hassle of having to piece together the examples from the public internet, which may not work on the platform. These ready-to-run and comprehensive notebooks in the AI Gallery assure users that they can run end-to-end examples without a hitch. Based on these examples, the users can only extend their experimentations and development for their specific needs. Not only that, these tutorials and notebooks exhibit the platform capabilities and integrations available on the platform in an interactive manner rather than having the users refer to a separate documentation.</p>

<p>Lastly, the AI Gallery encourages contributions from other Grabbers, fostering a collaborative environment. Users who are enthusiastic about creating educational contents on Chimera Sandbox can effectively share their work with other Grabbers.</p>

<div class="post-image-section"><figure>
